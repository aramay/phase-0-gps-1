###1.What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I feel like I had a solid grasp of all the git concepts that we learned about in week 1 and I don't feel that I struggled with any of them in particular.


###2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Like I mentioned earlier, all the concepts we were working with were clear to me and my pair but I definitely feel more comfortable with git since practice is the key!


###3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked the pair and the guide to clarify, about if it makes a difference if we push to master while we are in the feature branch, or if we are in the master branch. The guide told us that it doesn't make a difference but we should get in a habbit to always push from the feature branch.
Other than that I feel like the pairing session went pretty smooth.


###4. What still confuses you about git?

Me and my pair ran into some confusion while we were working on **Release 5: Merge Conflict** at first we skipped a step in the instructions and we decide to continue the following day. We managed to resolve the confusion and successfully completed the task.
I must say that the whole concept of conflicts is still a bit of a grey area and I would like to have more clarification and practice on that.


###5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I felt a little nervous at first, not sure why exactly, but I had a great experience overall both the pair and the guide were great and seemed to understand the material well. I'm looking forward for my next GPS! :)
